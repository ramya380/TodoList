# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

I built a responsive TODO list application with Reactjs,Material UI and local storage in which we will be able to add our tasks and delete our task . ![Screenshot (17)](https://github.com/ramya380/TodoList/assets/84365222/251e4f24-0db1-443e-bc2e-21a12ac42e5b)
